Recognizing Handwritten Digits with scikit-learn

        Let us understand first the motive of Recognizing Handwritten Digits. Identifying handwritten digits is sometimes difficult and problematic. It is hard task for the machine because handwritten are not perfect and can be made with different style. Classifying those are important now a days because everyone has his/her own style of writing digits which cannot be understood by another person in some of the cases. For example, the ZIP codes on letters at the post office and the automation needed to recognize these five digits. Perfect recognition of these codes is necessary in order to sort mail automatically and efficiently.

      We can make machine learn And Recognize digits automatically in different styles. As per above example you may have thought of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. OCR software must read handwritten text, or pages of printed books, for general electronic documents in which each character is well defined.
